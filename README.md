<div align="center">Meta-alerting with anomaly detection on NIDS sensors data (old project)</div>

## Foreword

NIDS sensors generate a tremendous number of alerts (often false positives) that are difficult to react on. Here are analyzed 3 public datasets that resulted in a 96-98% reduction of the number of alerts generated by those sensors.
