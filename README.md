<div align="center">Some fun improving anomaly detection on NIDS sensors (old project)</div>

## Foreword

NIDS sensors generate a tremendous number of alerts (false positives) that are impossible to dig through. Here I was playing with 3 public datasets to reduce by 96-98% the number of alerts generated by those sensors.
