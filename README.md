<div align="center">Meta-alerting compression of NIDS sensors data based on anomaly detection (old project)</div>

## Foreword

NIDS sensors can generate a tremendous number of alerts (most often false positives) that are hard to make sense of. Here are analyzed 3 public datasets, and resulted in a 96-98% compression ratio over the number of generated alerts.
